                    <h2>Prevalence and Impact</h2>
                    <p>Back pain is the most common pain complaint during pregnancy, affecting between 50&ndash;80% of pregnant women. According to research in <em>Spine</em> (2019), approximately one-third of pregnant women rate their back pain as severe, and 10% report that it significantly impairs daily function. Despite its prevalence, back pain in pregnancy is often undertreated, with many women told it is simply a normal part of pregnancy.</p>
                    <p>The pain typically begins between the 5th and 7th months of pregnancy but can start as early as 8&ndash;12 weeks. Approximately 25% of women continue to experience back pain postpartum, and some develop chronic pain that persists for years.</p>

                    <h2>Types of Pregnancy Back Pain</h2>
                    <h3>Lumbar Pain</h3>
                    <p>Located in the lower back at or above the waist, lumbar pain during pregnancy is similar to non-pregnancy-related low back pain. It increases with prolonged postures, forward flexion, and lifting. This type affects approximately 50% of women with pregnancy-related back pain.</p>
                    <h3>Posterior Pelvic Pain</h3>
                    <p>Felt below the waistline, around the sacroiliac joints, and sometimes radiating into the buttocks and posterior thighs. This is the more common type, affecting approximately 65&ndash;70% of women with pregnancy-related back pain. It is worsened by asymmetric loading activities such as stair climbing and single-leg stance.</p>
                    <h3>Thoracic Pain</h3>
                    <p>Upper and mid-back pain, often related to breast enlargement and postural changes. Particularly common in the third trimester and during breastfeeding.</p>

                    <h2>Causes and Contributing Factors</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Weight gain:</strong> Average pregnancy weight gain of 11&ndash;16 kg increases spinal loading by up to 100% on lumbar discs</li>
                        <li><strong>Postural changes:</strong> Progressive lumbar lordosis (30&ndash;40% increase) to compensate for anterior shift in center of gravity</li>
                        <li><strong>Hormonal ligament laxity:</strong> Relaxin increases collagen turnover and ligament extensibility, reducing spinal stability by up to 40%</li>
                        <li><strong>Abdominal muscle stretching:</strong> Rectus abdominis separation (diastasis recti) reduces core stability</li>
                        <li><strong>Vascular compression:</strong> Uterine pressure on the vena cava when supine, causing venous congestion in the pelvis and spine</li>
                        <li><strong>Prior history:</strong> Previous back pain is the strongest predictor, increasing risk 3&ndash;5 fold</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Evidence-Based Treatment Options</h2>
                    <h3>Exercise and Physical Therapy</h3>
                    <p>A 2015 Cochrane review of 34 studies found that exercise significantly reduces pregnancy-related low back pain. Recommended exercises include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pelvic tilts:</strong> Reduce lumbar lordosis and activate deep stabilizers. Perform 10&ndash;15 repetitions, 3 times daily</li>
                        <li><strong>Cat-cow stretches:</strong> Gentle spinal mobilization that relieves pressure on facet joints</li>
                        <li><strong>Bridging exercises:</strong> Strengthen gluteals and posterior chain. Progress from bilateral to single-leg as strength improves</li>
                        <li><strong>Side-lying clamshells:</strong> Target gluteus medius for pelvic stability</li>
                        <li><strong>Swimming/aquatic exercise:</strong> Buoyancy reduces spinal loading by 50&ndash;90% while providing resistance for strengthening</li>
                        <li><strong>Walking programs:</strong> 20&ndash;30 minutes daily at moderate intensity improves aerobic fitness and reduces pain scores</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Manual Therapy</h3>
                    <p>Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) has Level 1 evidence supporting its use in pregnancy back pain. A randomized trial in the <em>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</em> (2013) showed OMT reduced pain severity by 50% compared to standard care alone.</p>
                    <h3>Support Devices</h3>
                    <p>Maternity support belts provide external compression and proprioceptive feedback. A systematic review in <em>BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth</em> (2019) found moderate evidence supporting sacroiliac belts for posterior pelvic pain.</p>

                    <h2>Sleep and Ergonomic Strategies</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Side-lying with a pillow between the knees to maintain pelvic alignment</li>
                        <li>Full-body pregnancy pillow for comprehensive support</li>
                        <li>Avoid prolonged standing; use a small footstool to alternate hip flexion</li>
                        <li>When sitting, use lumbar support and keep feet flat on the floor</li>
                        <li>Log-roll technique for getting out of bed (turn to side, push up with arms)</li>
                    </ul>
