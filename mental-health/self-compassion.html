                <h2>What Is Self-Compassion?</h2>
                <p>Self-compassion means treating yourself with the same kindness, understanding, and care you would offer a good friend who is suffering. For people with chronic pain, self-compassion can reduce distress, improve coping, and even influence pain perception.<sup>1</sup></p>

                <h2>Three Components<sup>2</sup></h2>
                <h3>Self-Kindness (vs. Self-Judgment)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Treating yourself gently when things are hard</li>
                    <li>Avoiding harsh self-criticism</li>
                    <li>Speaking to yourself as you would a friend</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Common Humanity (vs. Isolation)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognizing suffering is part of human experience</li>
                    <li>You're not alone in your struggles</li>
                    <li>Many others understand what you're going through</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mindfulness (vs. Over-identification)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Acknowledging pain without drowning in it</li>
                    <li>Balanced awareness of difficulties</li>
                    <li>Neither ignoring nor amplifying suffering</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Increases willingness to engage in helpful activities</li>

                    <li>"This is my fault"</li>
                    <li>"I'm weak for struggling"</li>
                    <li>"Others have it worse"</li>
