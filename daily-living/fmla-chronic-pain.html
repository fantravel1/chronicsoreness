                    <h2>What Is the FMLA?</h2>
                    <p>The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal law that provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for qualifying medical conditions, including chronic pain. For many women living with conditions like fibromyalgia, endometriosis, or chronic back pain, FMLA is a critical protection that allows time for treatment, recovery, and pain management without fear of job loss.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Eligibility Requirements</h2>
                <p>To qualify for FMLA leave, you must meet all three criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Employer Size:</strong> Your employer must have 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius</li>
                    <li><strong>Employment Duration:</strong> You must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months (need not be consecutive)</li>
                    <li><strong>Hours Worked:</strong> You must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to leave (approximately 24 hours per week)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note that state laws may provide additional protections. Many states have their own family and medical leave laws that cover smaller employers or provide paid leave.</p>

                <h2>Chronic Pain as a Serious Health Condition</h2>
                <p>FMLA defines a &ldquo;serious health condition&rdquo; as one requiring either inpatient care or continuing treatment by a healthcare provider. Chronic pain qualifies when it involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days that also involves ongoing treatment</li>
                    <li>Any period of incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition requiring periodic visits (at least twice per year) to a healthcare provider</li>
                    <li>A condition that may cause episodic periods of incapacity (such as pain flares)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Types of FMLA Leave for Chronic Pain</h2>
                <h3>Continuous Leave</h3>
                <p>A single block of time off, such as recovery from surgery related to your pain condition. You may take up to 12 consecutive weeks.</p>
                <h3>Intermittent Leave</h3>
                <p>This is the most common type used by chronic pain patients. Intermittent FMLA allows you to take leave in separate blocks of time, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individual days or partial days during pain flares</li>
                    <li>Time for medical appointments, physical therapy, or treatments</li>
                    <li>Hours within a workday when pain becomes unmanageable</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Reduced Schedule Leave</h3>
                <p>Reducing your usual number of working hours per week. For example, working 30 hours instead of 40 to manage fatigue and pain.</p>

                <h2>How to Request FMLA Leave</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Notify Your Employer:</strong> Provide 30 days advance notice when foreseeable. For unexpected flares, notify as soon as practicable (typically the same day or next business day)</li>
                    <li><strong>Medical Certification:</strong> Your employer may require Form WH-380-E completed by your healthcare provider. They have 15 calendar days to return the form</li>
                    <li><strong>Employer Response:</strong> Your employer must designate leave as FMLA-qualifying within 5 business days of learning it may qualify</li>
                    <li><strong>Recertification:</strong> Employers may request recertification every 30 days or at the minimum duration specified on the certification</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Your Rights Under FMLA</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Job Protection:</strong> You must be restored to the same or an equivalent position upon return from leave</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefits Continuation:</strong> Your employer must maintain your group health insurance during FMLA leave under the same terms</li>
                    <li><strong>No Retaliation:</strong> Employers cannot count FMLA absences against you in attendance policies, performance reviews, or disciplinary actions</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Your medical information must be kept confidential and separate from your personnel file</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Common Employer Violations</h2>
                <p>Know the warning signs of FMLA violations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Counting FMLA absences as unexcused or in attendance point systems</li>
                    <li>Asking for more medical detail than the certification form requires</li>
                    <li>Denying intermittent leave or pressuring you to take continuous leave instead</li>
                    <li>Negative performance reviews based on FMLA-related absences</li>
                    <li>Reassigning you to a lesser position or reducing your hours as retaliation</li>
                    <li>Contacting your healthcare provider directly without your authorization</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What to Do If Your Rights Are Violated</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Document everything: keep copies of all communications, certifications, and leave records</li>
                    <li>File an internal complaint with HR, referencing specific FMLA regulations</li>
                    <li>File a complaint with the U.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division</li>
                    <li>Consult with an employment attorney specializing in FMLA claims</li>
                    <li>Complaints must be filed within 2 years of the violation (3 years for willful violations)</li>
                </ol>
