            <section>
                <h2>Understanding ME/CFS</h2>
                <p>Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, chronic, complex systemic disease that frequently and dramatically limits the activities of affected patients.<sup>1</sup> Unlike ordinary fatigue, the exhaustion of ME/CFS doesn't improve substantially with rest and is worsened by physical or mental exertion—a hallmark symptom called post-exertional malaise (PEM).<sup>2</sup></p>

                <div class="stat-box" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white; border-radius: 1rem; padding: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
                    <div style="font-size: 2.5rem; font-weight: 700;">836,000–2.5 million</div>
                    <div style="font-size: 1rem; opacity: 0.9;">Americans estimated to have ME/CFS<sup>1</sup></div>
                </div>

                <p>The Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine) proposed diagnostic criteria requiring:<sup>1</sup></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Substantial reduction or impairment in ability to engage in pre-illness activities for >6 months</li>
                    <li>Fatigue that is not the result of ongoing exertion and not substantially relieved by rest</li>
                    <li>Post-exertional malaise</li>
                    <li>Unrefreshing sleep</li>
                    <li>Plus cognitive impairment and/or orthostatic intolerance</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Women Are More Affected</h3>
                <p>Women comprise 60-85% of ME/CFS cases.<sup>3</sup> Several factors may contribute to this disparity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hormonal influences on immune function and inflammation</li>
                    <li>Higher rates of autoimmune conditions in women</li>
                    <li>Differences in stress response systems</li>
                    <li>Possible diagnostic bias (though research suggests true higher prevalence)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Core Symptoms</h2>

                <h3>Post-Exertional Malaise (PEM)</h3>
                <p>PEM is the cardinal symptom of ME/CFS and distinguishes it from other fatiguing conditions.<sup>2</sup> It involves a worsening of symptoms following physical, cognitive, or emotional exertion that would previously have been tolerated. Key characteristics include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Delayed onset (typically 12-48 hours after activity)</li>
                    <li>Disproportionate to the level of exertion</li>
                    <li>Prolonged recovery time (days to weeks)</li>
                    <li>May involve flu-like symptoms, increased pain, cognitive difficulties</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cognitive Dysfunction ("Brain Fog")</h3>
                <p>Cognitive impairment affects most people with ME/CFS and can include:<sup>4</sup></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty with concentration and attention</li>
                    <li>Slowed information processing</li>
                    <li>Memory problems (especially short-term)</li>
                    <li>Word-finding difficulties</li>
                    <li>Problems with multitasking</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Sleep Dysfunction</h3>
                <p>Despite profound exhaustion, sleep in ME/CFS is typically unrefreshing.<sup>5</sup> Common sleep issues include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unrefreshing sleep regardless of duration</li>
                    <li>Difficulty falling or staying asleep</li>
                    <li>Hypersomnia (excessive sleep without feeling rested)</li>
                    <li>Reversed sleep-wake cycle</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Orthostatic Intolerance</h3>
                <p>Many people with ME/CFS experience symptoms when upright that improve when lying down:<sup>6</sup></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lightheadedness or dizziness upon standing</li>
                    <li>Increased heart rate (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome/POTS)</li>
                    <li>Feeling faint or actually fainting</li>
                    <li>Worsening of other symptoms when upright</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Pain</h3>
                <p>Widespread pain is common in ME/CFS and may overlap with fibromyalgia:<sup>7</sup></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Muscle pain and tenderness</li>
                    <li>Joint pain (without swelling)</li>
                    <li>Headaches (new type, pattern, or severity)</li>
                    <li>Sore throat and tender lymph nodes</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Energy Management and Pacing</h2>
                <p>Pacing is the cornerstone of ME/CFS management. The goal is to stay within your "energy envelope"—the amount of energy available without triggering PEM.<sup>8</sup></p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>The Energy Envelope Concept</h4>
                    <p>Imagine you have a limited energy budget each day. Staying within your envelope means not spending more energy than you have, which helps prevent crashes and may gradually expand your capacity over time. Exceeding your envelope leads to PEM and potentially prolonged setbacks.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Pacing Strategies</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Activity tracking:</strong> Monitor activities and symptoms to identify your limits</li>
                    <li><strong>Pre-emptive rest:</strong> Rest before you feel exhausted, not after</li>
                    <li><strong>Breaking tasks:</strong> Divide activities into smaller chunks with rest periods</li>
                    <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Focus energy on most important activities</li>
                    <li><strong>Planning ahead:</strong> Schedule rest before and after demanding activities</li>
                    <li><strong>Heart rate monitoring:</strong> Some find staying below anaerobic threshold helpful</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Spoon Theory</h3>
                <p>Many people with chronic illness use "spoons" as a metaphor for limited energy units. Each activity costs a certain number of spoons, and once they're spent, you must rest or risk a crash. This concept helps communicate energy limitations to others.<sup>9</sup></p>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>Caution About Graded Exercise Therapy</h4>
                    <p>While once commonly recommended, graded exercise therapy (GET) is no longer advised as a primary treatment for ME/CFS. The 2021 NICE guidelines removed GET due to evidence that it can cause harm in some patients.<sup>10</sup> Any physical activity should be carefully paced and individualized, not progressively increased according to a fixed schedule.</p>

                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Medical Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>There is no FDA-approved treatment specifically for ME/CFS. Management focuses on symptom relief:<sup>11</sup></p>

                <h3>Medications That May Help</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, melatonin, or sleep medications</li>
