                <h2>Understanding Sciatica</h2>
                <p>Sciatica describes pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, which branches from your lower back through your hips and buttocks and down each leg.<sup>1</sup> The term "sciatica" is actually a symptom rather than a diagnosis—it indicates nerve root irritation, most commonly in the lower lumbar spine.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>The Sciatic Nerve</h3>
                <p>The sciatic nerve is the largest and longest nerve in the body:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forms from nerve roots L4, L5, S1, S2, and S3</li>
                    <li>About the thickness of a finger at its widest point</li>
                    <li>Runs from the lower back, through the buttock, down the back of the thigh</li>
                    <li>Branches into smaller nerves that continue into the lower leg and foot</li>
                    <li>Controls sensation and muscle function in the leg</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Common Causes</h2>
                <p>Several conditions can compress or irritate the sciatic nerve:<sup>3</sup></p>

                <h3>Herniated or Bulging Disc</h3>
                <p>The most common cause of sciatica (90% of cases):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disc material pushes against nerve roots</li>
                    <li>Most often affects L4-L5 or L5-S1 levels</li>
                    <li>Chemical irritation from disc material also contributes to pain</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Spinal Stenosis</h3>
                <p>Narrowing of the spinal canal, common in older adults:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bone spurs and thickened ligaments reduce space for nerves</li>
                    <li>Symptoms often worse with walking, relieved by sitting or bending forward</li>
                    <li>Usually develops gradually over time</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Degenerative Disc Disease</h3>
                <p>Age-related wear and tear on spinal discs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disc height decreases, potentially narrowing nerve pathways</li>
                    <li>May lead to instability and bone spur formation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Spondylolisthesis</h3>
                <p>Slippage of one vertebra over another:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can compress nerve roots exiting the spine</li>
                    <li>May be developmental or degenerative</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Piriformis Syndrome</h3>
                <p>Compression by the piriformis muscle in the buttock:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The sciatic nerve runs under (or through) this muscle</li>
                    <li>Muscle spasm or tightness can irritate the nerve</li>
                    <li>May be more common in women</li>
                    <li>Often related to sitting, running, or hip problems</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Pregnancy and Sciatica</h4>
                    <p>Sciatica is common during pregnancy due to weight gain, postural changes, and the baby's position potentially pressing on the sciatic nerve. The hormone relaxin also loosens ligaments, which can contribute to spine instability. Most pregnancy-related sciatica resolves after delivery.<sup>4</sup></p>

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Classic sciatica symptoms include:<sup>1,5</sup></p>

                <h3>Pain Characteristics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pain radiating from lower back through buttock and down the leg</li>
                    <li>Usually affects one side only</li>
                    <li>May be sharp, burning, or electric shock-like</li>
                    <li>Often worse when sitting, coughing, or sneezing</li>
                    <li>May be accompanied by low back pain (but leg pain is usually worse)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Neurological Symptoms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Numbness:</strong> Decreased sensation in leg or foot</li>

                </ul>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>Seek Immediate Medical Care If You Experience:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sudden severe weakness in the leg</li>
                        <li>Numbness in the groin or genital area (saddle anesthesia)</li>
                        <li>Loss of bladder or bowel control</li>
                        <li>Symptoms following significant trauma</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These may indicate cauda equina syndrome, a medical emergency requiring immediate surgery.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on history and physical examination:<sup>6</sup></p>

                <h3>Physical Examination</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Straight leg raise test:</strong> Raising the leg while lying down—positive if it reproduces leg pain</li>
                    <li><strong>Neurological exam:</strong> Testing reflexes, sensation, and muscle strength</li>
                    <li><strong>Gait assessment:</strong> Observing walking patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Range of motion:</strong> Evaluating spine flexibility</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Imaging Studies</h3>
                <p>Not usually needed initially, but may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>MRI:</strong> Best for visualizing soft tissue, disc herniations, and nerve compression</li>
                    <li><strong>CT scan:</strong> Detailed view of bone structures</li>
                    <li><strong>X-rays:</strong> Can show bone abnormalities, alignment, instability</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Imaging is typically reserved for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Symptoms lasting more than 6 weeks</li>
                    <li>Progressive neurological deficits</li>
                    <li>Red flags suggesting serious pathology</li>
                    <li>Consideration of interventional procedures or surgery</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Conservative Treatment</h2>
                <p>Most sciatica improves within 4-6 weeks with conservative care. Guidelines recommend starting with non-invasive treatments.<sup>7</sup></p>

                <h3>Stay Active</h3>
                <p>Perhaps counterintuitively, staying moderately active promotes faster recovery:<sup>8</sup></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bed rest is not recommended and may slow recovery</li>
                    <li>Continue normal activities as much as pain allows</li>
                    <li>Gentle walking is often helpful</li>
                    <li>Avoid activities that significantly worsen symptoms</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Heat and Cold</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ice may help in the first 48-72 hours (reduce inflammation)</li>
                    <li>Heat often feels better after the acute phase</li>
                    <li>Use whichever provides more relief</li>
                    <li>Apply for 15-20 minutes at a time</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Medications</h3>
                <p><strong>Over-the-counter options:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) for pain and inflammation</li>
                    <li>Acetaminophen for pain without anti-inflammatory effect</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Prescription options (when needed):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Muscle relaxants for associated muscle spasm</li>
                    <li>Gabapentinoids for nerve pain</li>
                    <li>Short-term oral steroids for severe acute cases</li>
                    <li>Opioids rarely recommended (short-term only if needed)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Physical Therapy</h3>
                <p>Physical therapy is highly effective for sciatica:<sup>9</sup></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exercises to improve flexibility and strength</li>
                    <li>McKenzie method (extension exercises)</li>
                    <li>Core stabilization training</li>

                <h2>Exercises for Sciatica</h2>
                <p>Specific exercises can help relieve sciatic pain. Always check with a healthcare provider before starting an exercise program.</p>

                <h3>Knee-to-Chest Stretch</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lie on your back with knees bent</li>
                    <li>Bring one knee toward your chest, holding behind the thigh</li>
                    <li>Keep the other foot flat on the floor</li>
                    <li>Hold 30 seconds, repeat 2-3 times each side</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Piriformis Stretch</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lie on your back, cross affected leg over opposite knee</li>
                    <li>Pull the uncrossed leg toward your chest</li>
                    <li>Feel the stretch in the buttock of the crossed leg</li>
                    <li>Hold 30 seconds, repeat 2-3 times</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Sciatic Nerve Glide</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sit on a chair, straighten one leg</li>
                    <li>Flex the foot (toes toward you) while extending the leg</li>
                    <li>Point the foot while bending the knee slightly</li>
                    <li>Repeat 10-15 times as a gentle pumping motion</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Press-Up (McKenzie Extension)</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lie face down, hands under shoulders</li>
                    <li>Press up, straightening arms while keeping hips on floor</li>
                    <li>Hold briefly, then lower back down</li>
                    <li>Repeat 10 times, several times daily</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Exercise Tip</h4>
                    <p>If an exercise significantly increases your leg pain, stop and try a different approach. Some pain relief should occur with proper exercises. If symptoms travel further down the leg ("peripheralization"), the exercise may not be appropriate.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Corticosteroid injected near the affected nerve root</li>
                    <li>May provide significant relief for weeks to months</li>
                    <li>Often used as a bridge to allow physical therapy to work</li>
                    <li>Limited number of injections recommended per year</li>
                    <li>Evidence supports short-term benefit; long-term efficacy less clear</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Removes part of the vertebral bone (lamina)</li>
                    <li>Creates more space for nerves</li>
                    <li>Often used for spinal stenosis</li>

                <h3>Surgery Outcomes</h3>
                <p>Research shows that patients with severe sciatica who have surgery often experience faster relief than those who continue conservative treatment, but at 1-2 years outcomes are often similar.<sup>11</sup></p>
