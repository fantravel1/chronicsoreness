                <h2>Understanding Plantar Fasciitis</h2>
                <p>Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of heel pain, resulting from irritation and degeneration of the plantar fascia—a thick band of tissue running from the heel bone to the toes along the bottom of the foot.<sup>1</sup> Despite its name suggesting inflammation ("-itis"), the condition is now understood to be primarily a degenerative process (plantar fasciosis) rather than inflammatory.<sup>2</sup></p>

                <div class="stat-box" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white; border-radius: 1rem; padding: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
                    <div style="font-size: 2.5rem; font-weight: 700;">2 Million</div>
                    <div style="font-size: 1rem; opacity: 0.9;">people treated for plantar fasciitis annually in the US<sup>1</sup></div>
                </div>

                <h3>Anatomy of the Plantar Fascia</h3>
                <p>The plantar fascia is a thick, fibrous band that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attaches to the heel bone (calcaneus) and spreads to the base of each toe</li>
                    <li>Acts like a bowstring supporting the arch of the foot</li>
                    <li>Absorbs shock during walking and running</li>
                    <li>Stores and releases elastic energy during gait</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What About Heel Spurs?</h3>
                <p>Heel spurs (bony growths) are often found in people with plantar fasciitis, but they're not the cause of pain. Studies show many people have heel spurs without any symptoms, and treating the fascia itself—not the spur—resolves the condition.<sup>3</sup></p>

            <section>
                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Classic plantar fasciitis symptoms include:<sup>1,4</sup></p>

                <h3>Characteristic Pain Patterns</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First-step pain:</strong> Sharp, stabbing pain with the first steps in the morning or after prolonged sitting</li>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Usually centered at the inside of the heel where the fascia attaches</li>
                    <li><strong>Improvement with activity:</strong> Pain often decreases after walking around but returns after rest</li>
                    <li><strong>Worsening with prolonged activity:</strong> Pain may increase after long periods of standing or walking</li>
                    <li><strong>Pain after exercise:</strong> Rather than during activity</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>The Classic "First-Step Pain"</h4>
                    <p>The hallmark of plantar fasciitis is intense pain with the first steps after waking up or sitting for extended periods. This occurs because the fascia tightens during rest and is suddenly stretched when you stand. The pain typically eases after a few minutes of walking as the tissue warms up.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>When to See a Doctor</h3>
                <p>Seek medical evaluation if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pain persists despite several weeks of self-care</li>
                    <li>Pain is severe or getting worse</li>
                    <li>You have numbness or tingling</li>
                    <li>Pain is present at night or at rest (may indicate other conditions)</li>
                    <li>You have difficulty bearing weight</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>Plantar fasciitis typically develops from repetitive stress and microtrauma to the fascia:<sup>5</sup></p>

                <h3>Primary Risk Factors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Most common between ages 40-60</li>
                    <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Excess weight increases stress on the fascia</li>
                    <li><strong>Foot mechanics:</strong> Flat feet, high arches, or abnormal gait patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Jobs requiring prolonged standing or walking on hard surfaces</li>
                    <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Running, jumping sports, or sudden increases in activity</li>
                    <li><strong>Tight calf muscles:</strong> Reduces ankle flexibility and increases fascia strain</li>
                    <li><strong>Footwear:</strong> Inadequate arch support, worn-out shoes</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Women and Plantar Fasciitis</h3>
                <p>Women may face additional risk factors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>High heels can shorten the Achilles tendon and calf muscles</li>
                    <li>Flats and ballet-style shoes often lack arch support</li>
                    <li>Pregnancy increases weight and releases hormones that loosen ligaments</li>
                    <li>Higher rates of certain conditions that can contribute to foot problems</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Conservative Treatment</h2>
                <p>Conservative measures resolve plantar fasciitis in 80-90% of cases, though full recovery often takes 6-12 months.<sup>6</sup></p>

                <h3>Rest and Activity Modification</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce activities that aggravate symptoms</li>
                    <li>Avoid going barefoot, especially on hard surfaces</li>
                    <li>Consider low-impact activities (swimming, cycling) while healing</li>
                    <li>Don't push through significant pain</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ice</h3>
                <p>Apply ice to reduce pain:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ice the heel for 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times daily</li>
                    <li>Rolling a frozen water bottle under the foot combines ice and massage</li>
                    <li>Never apply ice directly to skin</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Over-the-Counter Pain Relievers</h3>
                <p>NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) may help manage pain, though they don't address the underlying tissue changes. Use as directed and consult a healthcare provider for prolonged use.<sup>7</sup></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Stretching Exercises</h2>
                <p>Stretching is one of the most effective treatments for plantar fasciitis. A systematic review found that stretching programs significantly reduce pain and improve function.<sup>8</sup></p>

                <h3>Plantar Fascia Stretch</h3>
                <p>The most important stretch for this condition:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sit and cross the affected foot over the other knee</li>
                    <li>Grasp the toes and gently pull them back toward the shin</li>
                    <li>You should feel a stretch along the bottom of the foot</li>
                    <li>Hold for 30 seconds, repeat 10 times</li>
                    <li>Perform before the first steps in the morning and 3x daily</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Calf Stretches</h3>
                <p>Tight calf muscles contribute to plantar fasciitis:</p>

                <p><strong>Wall Calf Stretch (Gastrocnemius):</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Face a wall with hands at shoulder height</li>
                    <li>Step one foot back, keeping it straight and heel down</li>
                    <li>Lean forward until you feel a stretch in the calf</li>
                    <li>Hold 30 seconds, repeat 3 times each leg</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Bent-Knee Stretch (Soleus):</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Same position as above, but slightly bend the back knee</li>
                    <li>Keep the heel on the ground</li>
                    <li>Feel the stretch lower in the calf</li>
                    <li>Hold 30 seconds, repeat 3 times each leg</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Towel Stretch</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sit with legs extended in front of you</li>
                    <li>Loop a towel around the ball of your foot</li>
                    <li>Gently pull the towel toward you, keeping knee straight</li>
                    <li>Hold 30 seconds, repeat 3 times</li>
                    <li>Excellent for first thing in the morning before standing</li>
                </ol>

                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4>Stretching Tips</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Never stretch to the point of pain</li>

                    <li><strong>2-4 weeks:</strong> Some improvement with stretching and proper footwear</li>
                    <li><strong>6-8 weeks:</strong> Significant improvement for many people</li>
                    <li><strong>3-6 months:</strong> Most people recover with conservative treatment</li>
                    <li><strong>6-12 months:</strong> Stubborn cases may take longer</li>
                    <li><strong>12+ months:</strong> Consider advanced treatments if not improving</li>
                </ul>
