                <h2>Understanding Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</h2>
                <p>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common condition caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel—a narrow passageway in the wrist formed by bones and ligaments.<sup>1</sup> The median nerve provides sensation to the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring finger, and controls some small muscles at the base of the thumb.</p>

                <div class="stat-box" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); color: white; border-radius: 1rem; padding: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
                    <div style="font-size: 2.5rem; font-weight: 700;">3-6%</div>
                    <div style="font-size: 1rem; opacity: 0.9;">of the adult population is affected by carpal tunnel syndrome<sup>2</sup></div>
                </div>

                <h3>Anatomy of the Carpal Tunnel</h3>
                <p>The carpal tunnel is a rigid passageway about an inch wide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Floor and walls formed by the small carpal (wrist) bones</li>
                    <li>Roof formed by the transverse carpal ligament</li>
                    <li>Contains the median nerve and nine flexor tendons</li>
                    <li>Has limited space to accommodate swelling or increased pressure</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Women Are More Affected</h3>
                <p>Women develop CTS at three times the rate of men.<sup>3</sup> Contributing factors include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smaller carpal tunnel size relative to tendon size</li>
                    <li>Hormonal influences, especially during pregnancy and menopause</li>
                    <li>Higher rates of conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and thyroid disease</li>
                    <li>May be more likely to work in jobs with repetitive hand motions</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>CTS typically develops gradually and may affect one or both hands:<sup>1,4</sup></p>

                <h3>Early Symptoms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Numbness and tingling:</strong> In thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers</li>
                    <li><strong>Night symptoms:</strong> Often worse at night, may wake you from sleep</li>
                    <li><strong>"Shaking out":</strong> Relief from shaking or moving the hand</li>
                    <li><strong>Intermittent symptoms:</strong> Come and go initially</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Progressive Symptoms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Constant numbness:</strong> Symptoms become persistent</li>
                    <li><strong>Weakness:</strong> Difficulty gripping or holding objects</li>
                    <li><strong>Dropping things:</strong> Due to weakness or numbness</li>
                    <li><strong>Clumsiness:</strong> Difficulty with fine motor tasks</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Advanced Symptoms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Muscle wasting:</strong> Visible loss of muscle at base of thumb (thenar atrophy)</li>
                    <li><strong>Permanent numbness:</strong> Loss of sensation that may not fully recover</li>
                    <li><strong>Significant weakness:</strong> Difficulty with pinching and gripping</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>CTS occurs when the median nerve is compressed, but the exact cause isn't always clear. Contributing factors include:<sup>5</sup></p>

                <h3>Anatomical Factors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Naturally smaller carpal tunnel</li>
                    <li>Wrist fracture or dislocation affecting tunnel space</li>
                    <li>Arthritic changes in wrist bones</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Medical Conditions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> Fluid retention increases pressure in the tunnel</li>
                    <li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> Increases susceptibility to nerve compression</li>
                    <li><strong>Thyroid disorders:</strong> Especially hypothyroidism</li>
                    <li><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis:</strong> Inflammation affects wrist structures</li>
                    <li><strong>Kidney disease:</strong> Fluid retention</li>
                    <li><strong>Menopause:</strong> Hormonal changes and fluid retention</li>
                    <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Associated with increased risk</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Workplace and Activity Factors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Repetitive hand and wrist movements</li>
                    <li>Forceful gripping activities</li>
                    <li>Prolonged wrist flexion or extension</li>

                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>The Computer Use Question</h4>
                    <p>Despite popular belief, research has not established a strong link between computer use and carpal tunnel syndrome.<sup>6</sup> While keyboard work can cause other hand and wrist problems, the evidence doesn't support it as a major cause of CTS. However, proper ergonomics remain important for overall hand and wrist health.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
                <p>Diagnosis typically involves a combination of history, physical examination, and sometimes nerve testing:<sup>7</sup></p>

                <h3>Physical Examination</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phalen's test:</strong> Flexing wrists and pressing backs of hands together for 60 seconds—positive if symptoms reproduced</li>
                    <li><strong>Tinel's sign:</strong> Tapping over the carpal tunnel—positive if tingling occurs in fingers</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensation testing:</strong> Checking for reduced sensation in affected fingers</li>
                    <li><strong>Strength testing:</strong> Evaluating thumb muscle strength</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Electrodiagnostic Tests</h3>
                <p>Nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG) may be recommended to:<sup>8</sup></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confirm the diagnosis</li>
                    <li>Assess severity of nerve damage</li>
                    <li>Rule out other conditions</li>
                    <li>Guide treatment decisions</li>
                    <li>Provide baseline before surgery</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Imaging</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ultrasound:</strong> Can show median nerve swelling</li>
                    <li><strong>X-rays:</strong> May identify bone abnormalities</li>
                    <li><strong>MRI:</strong> Rarely needed but can show detailed anatomy</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Conservative Treatment</h2>
                <p>Non-surgical treatment is often effective, especially for mild to moderate CTS:<sup>9</sup></p>

                <h3>Wrist Splinting</h3>
                <p>Night splinting is one of the most effective conservative treatments:<sup>10</sup></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeps wrist in neutral position during sleep</li>
                    <li>Prevents wrist flexion that increases tunnel pressure</li>
                    <li>Typically worn for at least 3-4 weeks</li>
                    <li>Can also be worn during aggravating activities</li>
                    <li>Studies show 80% of patients improve with consistent splinting</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Activity Modification</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take frequent breaks from repetitive activities</li>
                    <li>Alternate hands when possible</li>
                    <li>Keep wrists in neutral position during activities</li>
                    <li>Avoid sustained gripping or pinching</li>
                    <li>Reduce force used in hand activities</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ergonomic Changes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Position keyboard so wrists are straight</li>
                    <li>Use ergonomic keyboard and mouse if helpful</li>
                    <li>Keep wrists neutral, not resting on hard surfaces</li>
                    <li>Take regular breaks from computer work</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Exercises</h3>

                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Surgical Treatment</h2>
                <p>Carpal tunnel release surgery is one of the most common surgeries in the United States and has high success rates:<sup>12</sup></p>

                <h3>When Surgery Is Recommended</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Symptoms don't improve with conservative treatment</li>
                    <li>Moderate to severe nerve damage on testing</li>
                    <li>Significant or progressive weakness</li>
                    <li>Persistent numbness affecting hand function</li>
                    <li>Visible muscle wasting</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Surgery</h3>
                <p><strong>Open Carpal Tunnel Release:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Traditional approach with incision in palm</li>
                    <li>Direct visualization of structures</li>
                    <li>Well-established long-term outcomes</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel Release:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Smaller incision(s) using a camera</li>
                    <li>May have faster initial recovery</li>
                    <li>Similar long-term outcomes to open surgery</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What to Expect</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Usually outpatient procedure under local anesthesia</li>
                    <li>Ligament is cut to relieve pressure on the nerve</li>
                    <li>Numbness and tingling often improve quickly</li>
                    <li>Grip strength recovery may take months</li>
                    <li>Success rate is 70-90% for symptom relief</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Recovery</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep hand elevated initially to reduce swelling</li>
                    <li>Move fingers frequently to prevent stiffness</li>
                    <li>Avoid heavy gripping for several weeks</li>
                    <li>Full recovery typically takes 2-3 months</li>
                    <li>Some weakness or pillar pain may persist for months</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Recovery Expectations</h4>
                    <p>Symptoms often improve immediately after surgery, but complete recovery varies. Patients with milder CTS and shorter duration of symptoms typically have better outcomes. Those with severe nerve damage may have permanent numbness or weakness even after surgery, which is why early treatment is important.</p>
