                <h2>What Is ACT?</h2>
                <p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (pronounced as one word "act") is a form of psychotherapy that helps people live meaningful lives while accepting pain and difficult emotions rather than struggling against them.<sup>1</sup></p>

                <h3>The Core Idea</h3>
                <p>Much of the suffering in chronic pain comes from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fighting against pain</li>
                    <li>Avoiding activities due to pain</li>
                    <li>Getting caught up in negative thoughts about pain</li>
                    <li>Putting life on hold until pain improves</li>
                </ul>
                <p>ACT suggests that while pain may not be controllable, our response to pain is. By changing our relationship to pain, we can reduce suffering and live more fully.</p>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <h4>Acceptance Is Not Giving Up</h4>
                    <p>In ACT, acceptance does not mean liking pain, wanting pain, or resigning yourself to a diminished life. It means acknowledging pain as it is, without wasting energy fighting the unfightable, so you can redirect that energy toward what matters to you.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>The Six Core Processes</h2>
                <p>ACT builds psychological flexibility through six interconnected processes:<sup>2</sup></p>

                <h3>1. Acceptance</h3>
                <p>Making room for pain and difficult feelings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allowing pain to be present without fighting it</li>
                    <li>Observing sensations with openness and curiosity</li>
                    <li>Reducing the "struggle layer" of suffering</li>
                    <li>Not the same as passive resignation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Cognitive Defusion</h3>
                <p>Changing your relationship to thoughts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognizing thoughts are just thoughts, not facts</li>
                    <li>Creating distance from unhelpful thoughts</li>
                    <li>Reducing the power of negative thinking</li>
                    <li>Example: Instead of "I can't do anything," notice "I'm having the thought that I can't do anything"</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Present Moment Awareness</h3>
                <p>Being fully engaged with the here and now:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mindful attention to current experience</li>
                    <li>Not dwelling on past or worrying about future</li>
                    <li>Noticing what is actually happening right now</li>
                    <li>Connection with the present moment</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Self-as-Context</h3>
                <p>Recognizing you are more than your pain:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are the observer of your experiences, not the experiences themselves</li>
                    <li>Pain and thoughts are passing experiences</li>
                    <li>A stable sense of self that pain cannot damage</li>
                    <li>"I am a person experiencing pain" rather than "I am a pain patient"</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Values</h3>
                <p>Clarifying what matters most to you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identifying your deepest values (family, creativity, helping others, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Values are directions, not destinations</li>
                    <li>Provides motivation and meaning</li>
                    <li>Guides decisions about how to live</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Committed Action</h3>
                <p>Taking action aligned with values despite pain:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Setting goals based on values</li>
                    <li>Taking steps toward meaningful life</li>
                    <li>Willingness to experience discomfort in service of values</li>
                    <li>Building patterns of effective action</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>ACT vs. Traditional CBT</h2>
                <p>While both are effective for chronic pain, they differ in approach:<sup>3</sup></p>

                <h3>Traditional CBT</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focuses on changing unhelpful thoughts</li>
                    <li>Aims to reduce negative thinking</li>
                    <li>Challenges and restructures cognitions</li>
                    <li>Goals often include pain reduction</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ACT</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focuses on changing relationship to thoughts</li>
                    <li>Accepts thoughts without fighting them</li>
                    <li>Creates distance from thoughts rather than changing them</li>
                    <li>Goals focus on valued living, not pain control</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Both approaches have research support. Some people respond better to one than the other, and many therapists use elements of both.</p>

                <h2>ACT Exercises</h2>
                <p>Simple techniques to start practicing ACT principles:</p>

                <h3>The Struggle Switch</h3>
                <p>Imagine you have a "struggle switch" inside:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When ON, you fight against pain and negative feelings</li>
                    <li>This fighting creates additional suffering</li>
                    <li>Turning it OFF means allowing pain to be present</li>
                    <li>Energy goes toward values instead of struggle</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Leaves on a Stream</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Close your eyes and imagine sitting beside a stream</li>
                    <li>Leaves are floating by on the water</li>
                    <li>As thoughts arise, place each one on a leaf</li>
                    <li>Watch the leaf float downstream</li>
                    <li>When mind wanders, gently return to watching leaves</li>
                    <li>Practice for 5-10 minutes</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This exercise creates distance from thoughts without fighting them.</p>

                <h3>"I'm Having the Thought That..."</h3>
                <p>When you notice an unhelpful thought:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instead of: "I can't cope with this pain"</li>
                    <li>Say: "I'm having the thought that I can't cope with this pain"</li>
                    <li>Then add: "I notice I'm having the thought that I can't cope with this pain"</li>
                    <li>This creates distance and reduces the thought's power</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Values Clarification</h3>
                <p>Reflect on these questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What kind of person do you want to be?</li>
                    <li>What matters most to you in life?</li>
                    <li>If pain were less of a barrier, what would you do more of?</li>
                    <li>What do you want your life to stand for?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Common values domains: family, relationships, work, health, growth, creativity, community, spirituality.</p>

                <h3>Willingness</h3>
                <p>Practice being willing to experience discomfort:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose a valued activity you have been avoiding</li>
                    <li>Notice the urge to avoid due to potential pain</li>
                    <li>Ask: "Am I willing to have this discomfort in order to do what matters?"</li>
                    <li>If yes, take action while making room for whatever shows up</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Applying ACT to Daily Life</h2>

                <h3>When Pain Increases</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Notice the pain with curiosity rather than alarm</li>
                    <li>Allow it to be present without fighting</li>
                    <li>Observe your thoughts about the pain</li>
                    <li>Ask: What value-aligned action can I take right now?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>When Struggling with Activity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connect with why this activity matters (the value behind it)</li>
                    <li>Be willing to have pain as you engage</li>
                    <li>Notice thoughts urging you to stop, and continue anyway</li>
                    <li>Celebrate that you are living by your values</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Setting Values-Based Goals</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify an important value</li>
                    <li>Choose a specific action that reflects this value</li>
                    <li>Make it achievable (small steps)</li>
                    <li>Note the willingness required</li>
                    <li>Take action and notice the experience</li>

                <h2>Finding ACT Treatment</h2>

                <h3>Individual Therapy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for therapists specifically trained in ACT</li>
                    <li>Association for Contextual Behavioral Science has a therapist directory</li>
                    <li>Ask about experience with chronic pain</li>
                    <li>Sessions typically weekly, 8-16 sessions or ongoing</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Group Programs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pain clinics may offer ACT-based groups</li>
                    <li>Can be effective and more affordable</li>
                    <li>Benefit from peer support</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Self-Help Resources</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Living Beyond Your Pain</em> by JoAnne Dahl and Tobias Lundgren</li>
                    <li><em>The Happiness Trap</em> by Russ Harris (general ACT)</li>

                    <h4>Starting Point</h4>
                    <p>If you are interested in ACT, a good starting point is reading one of the self-help books above. They include many exercises and can be used alone or alongside therapy. For more complex situations, individual therapy is recommended.</p>

                <h2>Common Questions</h2>

                <h3>Does acceptance mean I should stop treating my pain?</h3>
                <p>No. ACT does not discourage medical treatment. Acceptance means not putting your life on hold while fighting pain. You can accept pain AND take appropriate medical action.</p>

                <h3>Won't accepting pain make it worse?</h3>
                <p>Research shows the opposite—acceptance often reduces pain intensity over time, likely because less struggle means less stress, which reduces the nervous system's alarm state.</p>

                <h3>Is ACT saying the pain is in my head?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely not. ACT recognizes pain is real. It addresses the psychological suffering that accompanies pain, which is also real and important to address.</p>

                <h3>How long until I see results?</h3>
                <p>Some people notice shifts quickly; for others it takes longer. Typically, 8-12 weeks of practice shows meaningful improvement. Like any skill, benefits increase with practice.</p>
